# Machine-Learning-Exercise
Fully Convolutional Neural Network to classify each pixel in an aerial image as roof or non-roof.

To run, simply run "run_code.py":

Specify:

- n_dim (height/width of image patches)
- weights (path to weights file)
- train_image/train_labels. 
- Retrain via `train == True` 
- Train using cross-validation via `valid == True`
