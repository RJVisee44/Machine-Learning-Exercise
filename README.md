# Machine-Learning-Exercise
Fully Convolutional Neural Network to classify each pixel in an aerial image as roof or non-roof.

To run, simply run "run_code.py":

**NOTE: Train.py needs to be modified to accept correct input for model

Specify:

n_dim (height/width of image patches), weights (path to weights file), train_image/train_labels. 
Also specify if you want to retrain via boolean train and if you want to perform validation via boolean valid.
